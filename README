Raremetal2 is an updated version of the meta-analysis software Raremetal
It is 30% faster than the original version and takes less memory
Compatiable with old Raremetalworker or rvtest generated summary files

This is still a beta version. Single-variant meta-analysis looks good on T2D and MGI data,  but needs more optimizations on group test.

New features:
1. new method for unbalanced studies. To toggle that, please specify --useExact
2. multi-allelic site meta-analysis enabled. However, if you have Raremetalworker or rvtest covariance files from previous versions, multi-allelic site meta-analysis won't work well in group test because these old covariance files do not record alleles for each sites.
3. missing data in conditional analysis
